## 🎯 Learning & Purpose

This project was built with the goal of using technology for social good. It allowed me to apply core web development concepts like authentication, routing, session handling, and file uploads while also understanding how to manage a meaningful user experience through geolocation-based filtering and reporting. From a backend perspective, I gained hands-on experience integrating MongoDB with Mongoose, building a structured MVC-like Node.js application, and implementing secure authentication. It reflects how digital tools can be used to improve civic engagement and accountability.
